# Reddit UWP App

This app was developed as a coding challenge for a job application. The premise was to create a simple app to display reddit posts using UWP (Universal Windows Platform) in less than 4 hours.

Some features include:
* Side list navigation with a maximum of 10 items displayed.
* Red Indicator of read/unread posts
* Comments and creation time display
* Dismiss button. When dismissing an item from the list, a new reddit post will be fetched to always display 10 items.
